# project-maps
Ever dreamt of generating maps the same way you can in video-games? This is an attempt to do so called project-maps! We used an Arduino, a touch screen, 5 ultrasonic sensors, an accelerometer and a GPS to generate maps as accurately as possible live on your touch screen by measuring the distance between you and nearby walls. The maps are saved on an SD card, to let you easily transfer the generated data to your PC.

That's how it looks when you wear it:
