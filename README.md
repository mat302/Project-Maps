# Project-Maps
This is Project Maps, a map generator system that uses 5 sensors, a GPS chip and an accelerometer to generate maps live on a touch screen with many navigation features you can use. You can also resuse the maps later on a personal computer simply by pulling out the micro SD card from the device. The maps are generated using your position with GPS coordinates and an accelerometer for more precision and 5 sensors to generate the walls around you.
